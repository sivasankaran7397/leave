      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>The Helping Hands Foundation is a registered non-profit organization dedicated to transforming the lives of underprivileged communities in India through education, healthcare, and empowerment programs.

      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>Founded in 2010 by a group of passionate social workers, Helping Hands Foundation began with small community service projects in local villages. Over time, our initiatives expanded to multiple states, supported by volunteers, donors, and partners who believe in sustainable change.</p>
      <p>Our journey started with just a handful of volunteers and has now grown into a wide-reaching movement of over 5,000 contributors working towards a common goal â€“ inclusive and equitable development for all.</p>
